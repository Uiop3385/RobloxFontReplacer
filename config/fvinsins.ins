To install your font, simply drag and drop the font that you chose into
the Fonts folder of your system.
We've opened both of these folders : the one where the font is located,
and the one where your system fonts are located.
Once you drag and drop, your system will automatically install it.
You may need to reboot your computer before you can use it locally
in other programs.
